    "AIExplanation": "This policy grants overly broad access.  The `Resource: '*'` allows access to *all* S3 buckets and CloudWatch resources across the entire AWS account. This exposes the entire organization to potential data breaches and unauthorized metric viewing, significantly increasing risk.  A much more restrictive policy with specific bucket and metric resource names is necessary.\n"
